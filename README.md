# Lambda-AWS-Automated-Alarm-Creation
AWS Lambda routines to create common CloudWatch alarms

This project is intended to use AWS Lambda for creating alarms based on AWS cloudwatch events. (For example every time an instance is started in an autoscaling group this Lambda function in combination with CloudWatch Event can auto add custom alarms)
